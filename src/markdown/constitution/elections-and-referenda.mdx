1. **Process.** All elections and referenda are held through a democratic process by secret ballot.
    1. **Ballot timing.** The final form of the ballot must be made public and voting must begin at least seven days prior to the completion of the election or referendum.
    1. **Election timing.** Applications for all Executive positions for a given academic term should be received before the first day of the lecture period for that academic term.
2. **Elections Committee.**
    1. **Composition.** The Elections Committee consists of:
        1. the Chair; and
        1. any other members appointed by consensus of the Executives.
    1. **Eligibility.** Elections Committee members must be general members of the DDC and have at least one term of experience as an Executive.
    1. **Term.** Members of the Elections Committee continue to serve until they are removed by the Executive or lose eligibility.
    1. **Duties.** The Elections Committee is the only one with the power and duty to:
        1. administer elections and referenda in accordance with the constitution and applicable policies;
        1. notify eligible general members of elections and referenda, with reasonable time to consider the ballot; and
        1. assist in the transition between academic terms and provide continuing support to the Executive.
    1. **Restrictions.** Overriding the voting rights of general members,
        1. no member of the Elections Committee administering an election can stand on the ballot for that election; and

    1. **Completion.** The election or referendum is considered complete at the moment the announcement is made public.
