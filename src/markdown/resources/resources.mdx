## Grade Conversions
Double Degree students have a transcript at both the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University. However, UW assigns a numeric grade out of 100 and WLU assigns an alphabetic grade on their 12-point scale. The following chart describes how to convert grades between both universities:
<br />
| UW Course  Grade | WLU Letter  Grade | Letter Grade  Conversion for UW Avg | Grade Points for WLU  GPA | 4.0 GPA Scale |

## Common Confusions
Getting the same "percentage grade" in a course can show up differently at UW or WLU. For example, a 76 in a UW course will result in an 8 (i.e., B) being recorded at WLU. Getting a 76 in a WLU course also results in a B, but it is converted to a 75 at UW.

UW and WLU both maintain "averages" reported on their transcripts. These are averages of their respective grading systems. For example, a student with three Waterloo courses with grades 60, 70, 80 and three Laurier courses with grades A, B, C will see an average of 73.2 on their UW transcript (calculated as (60+70+80+89+75+65)รท6) and an average of 7.5 on their WLU transcript (calculated as (4+7+10+11+8+5)รท6).

<div id="mentorship">
## Mentorship
  
The DDC Mentorship Program is designed to help incoming students make the transition into post-secondary life under the wing of an upper-year student. Mentors answer any questions or concerns that new students may have, which can be especially useful when dealing with cross-university affairs. The Program gives new students the opportunity to network with upper-year students and others from their class, allowing them to meet and interact with like-minded students who are pursuing the same academic goals. Applications to be matched with a mentor will generally be announced through the UW mailing list in late-July or early-August. If you have missed the deadline and interested in having a mentor, reach out to an executive to be matched with one.
